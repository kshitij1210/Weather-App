# Weather-App
It is an Android App made by using JAVA which tells the temperature, weather conditions and latitude and longitude of a place.
 It has the following features -

1. Takes weather data of any city from an API.
2. Parses the data and converts it into readable form and displays it.
3. Also remembers the last city you checked and displays data about the same city when app is opened.

Its not that advanced Weather App though it serves the purpose.
